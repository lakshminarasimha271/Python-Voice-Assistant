Step 1: Setup
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. We'll use the following libraries:

SpeechRecognition: For recognizing speech from audio input.
pyttsx3: For text-to-speech conversion.
pyaudio: For audio input/output operations.
wikipedia: For querying and retrieving information from Wikipedia.
requests: For making HTTP requests (optional, for web APIs).
datetime: For handling date and time operations.

Explanation:
speak(text): Uses pyttsx3 to convert text into speech and speak it out loud.
recognize_speech(): Uses speech_recognition to listen for audio input from the microphone, recognize speech using Google's speech recognition service, and return the recognized query as text.
perform_action(query): Performs various actions based on the user's query. Currently supports:
Searching Wikipedia for information.
Providing the current time and date.
Responding to gratitude and exiting the program.
